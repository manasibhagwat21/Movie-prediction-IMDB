# Movie-prediction-IMDB
Developed predictive models for IMDb movie ratings using Machine Learning algorithms and neural networks including Random Forest, XGBoost and Decision Tree.
Skilled in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques using Python.

## Data Preprocessing
Performed data preprocessing by dropping null values, dealing with missing data.
Performed feature engineering by selecting only relevant roles for prediction model.
